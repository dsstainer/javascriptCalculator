# A very simple javascript calculator
This is a calculator app which can deal with expressions using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and brackets
It uses a variant of the shunting yard algorithm in order to achieve this.

# How to use
Just clone the git repo and open the html file to run locally on your machine
Type in an infix expression, and press the equals sign.
Voila, the result appears in the display.

Note: the calculator has no memory so will not remember your previous result
